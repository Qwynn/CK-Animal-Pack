# CK Animal Pack
A fork of [CK Animals and Plants Pack](https://github.com/kaptain-kavern/CK_AnimalPlant_Pack). This version is updated to A16 and guts the entire mod leaving only the animals intact for a broader range of compatability (or people who just wanted their excellent work on the additional animals).
